#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

c

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1 The Software Crisis (Late 1960s)
Prior to high-level languages, programmers had to write code in machine language or assembly language, which was extremely tedious and error prone
This crisis brought the need for a structured approach to software development, which led to the birth of software engineering as a formal discipline.
The 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference detected and adressed this issues
📄 2. Introduction of the Waterfall Model (1970)
 Waterfall Model was then introduced, one of the first structured software development methodol
It provided a linear and sequential approach with distinct phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenan
Although later criticized for its rigidity, it laid the groundwork for formal project management and documentation standards.
🔄 3. Rise of Agile Methodologies (Early 2000
The software industry sought more flexible alternatives to rigid models like Waterfall, leading to the Agile Manifesto in 2
Agile emphasizes collaboration, adaptability, iterative development, and customer feedback.
This shift has become the dominant approach in modern software development, enabling faster delivery and continuous improvement.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle..
Planning;Stakeholders gather requirements and conduct feasibility studies to determine the project's viability.
Requirement analysis;requirement specification documentation
Design;designing the user inertface
Implementation; Involves source code and executable programs.
Testing;Test the project for bugs
Deployment;user manuals
Maintanance;maintanance plans and updates

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-collaborate with team to create amazing stuff
                  -testing and fixing bugs
  quality assurance engineer -Tracking and reporting bugs
                             -Ensuring quality standards
                             
  Project manager-Creating and managing project plans
                 -Cordination between team members and stakeholders

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs
Provide environment where developers can write, test and debug their codes. eg debugging tools
Comes with inegreted tools thus reducing need of switching to different tools.eg VS code
Version  Control Systems
Allow multiple developers to wrk on same codebase
Allow develpers work on new features from main codebase
examples gIt

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Projects become diffcult to manage and complex as they grow in size.Break the project into smaller managaeble problems
Keeping up with the rapid technlogical changes.Attend workshops conferences and online courses
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
UNIT;testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure they work as intended.Helps detect bug early in development phase
INTEGRATION;focuses on testing the interactions between different components or modules of the software.verifies that different parts of the system interact seamlessly.
SYSTEM;testing the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.It ensures that the entire system functions correctly
ACCEPTANCE;determine whether the software meets the acceptance criteria defined by the stakeholders and is ready for deployment.validates that the software meets the user's needs and requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 designing and refining input prompts to effectively guide and interact with AI models.
 Well-structured prompts can lead to more accurate, relevant, and coherent AI outputs.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague Tell me about kenya."
improved explain the effects of corruption in kenya
effective  because it reduces time used to answer the question
